To Extract all earnings from Simulation:

Sub ExtractData()
    Dim wsSource As Worksheet
    Dim wsDest As Worksheet
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, k as Integer
    
    Set wsSource = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Simulations")
    Set wsDest = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Earnings")
    
    
    For i = 1 To 10
        For j = 1 To 1000
	    For k = 1 to 12
            	wsDest.Cells(j+1, i).Value = wsSource.Cells(3 + (i - 1) * 16 + k , 9*j).Value
	    Next k
        Next j
    Next i
End Sub


To Find Yearly Earnings:

Sub ExtractData()
    Dim wsSource As Worksheet
    Dim wsDest As Worksheet
    Dim sum as Double
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, k as Integer
    
    Set wsSource = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Earnings")
    Set wsDest = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Yearly Earnings")
    
    
    For i = 1 To 10
        For j = 1 To 1000
	    sum = 0
	    For k = 1 to 12
            	sum = sum + wsSource.Cells(12*(j-1) + k +1 , i).Value
	    Next k
	wsDest.Cells(j,i)=sum
        Next j
    Next i
End Sub


For Extracting May data for all (10 Simulation, 1000 paths):

Sub ExtractData()
    Dim wsSource As Worksheet
    Dim wsDest As Worksheet
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
    
    Set wsSource = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Simulations")
    Set wsDest = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("May Data")
    
    
    For i = 1 To 10
        For j = 1 To 1000
                wsDest.Cells(j + 2, 3 * (i - 1) + 1).Value = wsSource.Cells(3 + (i - 1) * 16 + 1, 9 + 9 * (j - 1)).Value    'Earnings
                wsDest.Cells(j + 2, 3 * (i - 1) + 2).Value = wsSource.Cells(3 + (i - 1) * 16 + 1, 6 + 9 * (j - 1)).Value    'Jet Kerosene
                wsDest.Cells(j + 2, 3 * (i - 1) + 3).Value = wsSource.Cells(3 + (i - 1) * 16 + 1, 7 + 9 * (j - 1)).Value    'AUD/USD
        Next j
    Next i
End Sub
